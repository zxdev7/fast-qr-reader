🚀 Deploy and Host QR Reader/Generator API on Railway
QR Reader/Generator API is a FastAPI-based service that allows users to generate QR codes from any text or URL and read QR codes from image files. It's a lightweight, fast, and scalable solution ideal for developers who want to add QR functionality to their applications.

🧰 About Hosting QR Reader/Generator API
Hosting the QR Reader/Generator API involves deploying a FastAPI application on Railway’s cloud infrastructure. The app provides two main endpoints: one for generating QR codes (outputting PNG images) and another for decoding QR codes from uploaded images. Using Railway simplifies the deployment process — just push your code, and Railway handles environment setup, build, and deployment. There's no need to worry about server configuration, load balancing, or manual scaling. It’s an ideal choice for teams building internal tools, web apps, or microservices that require quick and reliable QR code processing.

🌍 Common Use Cases
🔐 Authentication & Login — Generate QR codes for temporary login links or 2FA

📦 Product Packaging — Print QR codes on labels with embedded product info

🎟️ Ticketing Systems — Use QR codes for event check-ins or reservations

📦 Dependencies for QR Reader/Generator API Hosting
Python 3.11+ – Language runtime

FastAPI – High-performance Python web framework

qrcode – Python library for generating QR codes

Pillow (PIL) – Image processing backend for QR generation

pyzbar – QR decoding from images

OpenCV – Used for image preprocessing before decoding

⚙️ Implementation Details <OPTIONAL>
Here’s a simple example of how endpoints work in FastAPI:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import qrcode
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/generate")
def generate_qr(data: dict):
    qr_img = qrcode.make(data["text"])
    buf = BytesIO()
    qr_img.save(buf, format="PNG")
    buf.seek(0)
    return StreamingResponse(buf, media_type="image/png")

@app.post("/read")
def read_qr(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    image = Image.open(file.file)
    result = decode(image)
    return {"data": result[0].data.decode()} if result else {"error": "No QR found"}
🚀 Why Deploy QR Reader/Generator API on Railway?
Railway is a singular platform to deploy your infrastructure stack. Railway will host your infrastructure so you don't have to deal with configuration, while allowing you to vertically and horizontally scale it.

By deploying QR Reader/Generator API on Railway, you are one step closer to supporting a complete full-stack application with minimal burden. Host your servers, databases, AI agents, and more on Railway.
